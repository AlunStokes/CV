\begin{rSection}{Research Interests}
My interests lie in computing and mathematics, particularly number theory and symbolic algebra. 
%I am specifically interested in additive number theory, Diophantine equations, and prime numbers.
I am currently interested in dessins d'enfants and the computation of their Belyi maps. I write software for high-performance and distributed computing and have substantial experience in various machine learning techniques.
