\begin{rSection}{Research Interests}
My interests lie in \textbf{mathematics and computing}, particularly \textbf{number theory} and \textbf{symbolic algebra}. Very recent interests include homotopy continuation and symbolic regression.
%I am specifically interested in additive number theory, Diophantine equations, and prime numbers.
%I am currently interested in dessins d'enfants and the computation of their Belyi maps from their permutation representations and passports. I write software for high-performance and distributed computing, along with reasonably extensive experience with (pretty much the gamut of) machine learning techniques.
Generally, I study \textbf{dessins d'enfants} and my work is often predicated on the computation of \textbf{Belyi maps} from permutation representations and passports. I often write software for \textbf{high-performance, parallel, and distributed computing} and have reasonably extensive experience with a broad range of \textbf{modern machine learning} techniques.
