\begin{rSection}{Research Interests}
My interests lie at the intersection of computing and mathematics, particularly in number theory. 
%I am specifically interested in additive number theory, Diophantine equations, and the prime numbers.
I am currently interested in the theory of dessins d'enfants, and the computation of their Belyi maps. In general, I write software for high-performance and distributed computing, and have substantial experience in several areas of machine learning.
