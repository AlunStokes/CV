%{\bf Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions in the Body using Minimal-Input Neural Networks}\\
%This was a data science competition focusing on the effects of recreational drugs. We designed a neural network that would predict, using only experimental properties of a compound, and with no knowledge of drug structure, whether or not two compounds would interact in the body. This achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.2\%. We presented a seminar on this paper at York University, and the paper has been published in the STEM Fellowship Journal. \\

%{\bf Using Agent-Based Modelling to Simulate Tumour Growth and Progression}\\
%Using agent-based modelling, canine transmissible venereal tumours were simulated, and the effects of various treatment methods on this growth were examined. Specifically, we investigated the immunohistological environment of the tumour and how changing MHC expression and various Ig concentrations affected tumour spread and virility. \\

% {\bf An Experiment in Plant-Animal Interactions}\\
% In this project, we designed and carried out a factorial experiment to assess the type and extent of herbivory by \textit{Myzus persicae} on \textit{Arabadopsis thaliana}. Specifically, we examined the effect that soil-nitrate content had on this relationship. A paper was written discussing the findings and statistical analyses applied, after which a small presentation was given to summarize the results. \\
